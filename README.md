# Ben Spooner â€” Product Builder & WebLLM Specialist

Welcome. This is the source code for my personal site.

Iâ€™m a solo software developer who designs, builds, and ships products end-to-end â€” with a strong focus on AI-native UX and browser-first tools.  

### ðŸ§  Specialism: WebLLM

WebLLM is a privacy-first, in-browser LLM that runs entirely on the client â€” no API calls, no cloud compute. I specialize in integrating this into real-world tools to reduce server costs, enhance data privacy, and keep everything local â€” no cloud required.

### ðŸ“¬ Contact

If youâ€™ve got a project and want to explore building it with WebLLM â€” or just need a clean, fast build â€” get in touch.
